### Chalenges find by jedeias:

* This project was slow to develop, mainly due to the variety of paradigms and the set of new tools with which I was not familiar, such as Composer's PSR-4 and TDD. The database brought some novelties as we had not yet dealt with triggers. It was challenging to combine most of the concepts I know while dealing with new systems, but it is satisfying to see the progress of the system.
